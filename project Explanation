this is my internship assigment to Make an secure, scalable backend systems. Alongside building strong backend APIs, you will also create a basic frontend UI to demonstrate and interact with your APIs.

Core features will be 

User registration & login APIs with password hashing and JWT authentication + Role-based access (user vs admin)

API versioning, error handling, validation + API documentation (Swagger/Postman) + CRUD APIs for a secondary entity (e.g., tasks, notes, or products)

Database schema (Postgres/MySQL/MongoDB)
database we used in this project is Postgres with proper database schema to make it scalable and secure (code available in scripts/initDatabase.js)

Basic Frontend (Supportive)
    Build with React.js / Next.js / Vanilla JS 
        Simple UI to: 
          Register & log in users + Access protected dashboard (JWT required) +Perform CRUD actions on the entity +Show error/success messages from API responses (code in frontend/index.html)
          <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff3269bf-a6c5-40bd-a546-ce0a640c0a72" />


Security & Scalability
Secure JWT token handling + Input sanitization & validation + Scalable project structure for new modules + Optional: caching (Redis), logging, or Docker deployment

everything will be avaialble in code in there own folders 
and one video will be attaced to showcase the whole working of the project 

thank you :-D
